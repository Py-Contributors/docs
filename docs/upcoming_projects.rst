Upcoming Projects
=================

1. Voice Authenticator (VA) - A voice authentication system that uses
   the user's voice to authenticate the user. The system will be implemented in Python width
   the help of the deep learning library Keras/pytorch. 

2. Accuracy metrics - implementation of machine learning Accuracy metrics
   in Python. like F1 score, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix, ROC curve, AUC, etc.

3. Image Augmentation - implementation of image augmentation for the
   training of the neural network models. it will be implemented in
   numba instead of numpy. Numba is a just-in-time compiler for python
    code. it is faster than numpy and it is easier to use than cython.
    It will make the code more faster.
